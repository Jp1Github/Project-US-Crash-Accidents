Here are my codes to analyze the data and develop machine learning model learned.

The mistakes and failures and what I have learned and needed to be improved.
I have enjoyed this project that makes me to do a lot of research to further my knowledge on:
- Python
- Jupyter and Pandas
- Statistics
- Different modelling of machine learning techniques
  
It also showed my patience and perserverance which I am very proud of.

Sequence for this notebook:

Objective: Can a machine learning predict the target "Severity" with a certain road feature.

1. US_Accident_Crash_Data_Cleaning.
   Here is cleaning the data, change to the appropriate data type, renaming columns and others.
   
2. Feature_Analysis.
   Conduct further cleaning, analysis and some preprocessing.
   Analyzing the covariance, correlation and other statistical information. I created additional
   features here that cause high correlation in the target variable. That produced unusual results.
   
4. Preprocess_Modelling.
   Corrected the issue and employed some appropriate preprocessing.
   Tested four (4) supervised machine learning and one (1) deep learning.
  
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Naive Bayes
   - XGBoost
   - Tensor Flow

   In the conclusion are my learning, insights and thoughts about this project.

   Thank you for your time reading my project.
