Here are my codes to analyze the data and develop machine learning model learned.

The mistakes and failures and what I have learned and needed to be improved.
I have enjoyed this project that makes me to do a lot of research to further my knowledge on:
- Python
- Jupyter and Pandas
- Statistics
- Different modelling of machine learning techniques
  
It also showed my patience and perserverance which I am very proud of.
