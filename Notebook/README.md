In this project, I analyzed the data and developed a machine-learning model using the following code. Along the way, I encountered some mistakes and failures, which helped me learn and improve. This project was enjoyable and rewarding, as it required me to do a lot of research and deepen my understanding of:

- Python
- Jupyter and Pandas
- Statistics
- Various machine learning methods
  
I demonstrated patience and perseverance in this project, which I am very proud of.

- Objective: To predict the target "Severity" of road accidents using machine learning based on certain road features.

  **Sequence for this notebook:**
  
**1. US_Accident_Crash_Data_Cleaning:**
   
   In this section, I cleaned the data, changed the data types to appropriate ones, renamed the columns, and performed other tasks.

**2. Feature Analysis:**

   In this section, I conducted further cleaning, analysis, and some preprocessing of the data. I analyzed the covariance, correlation, and 
   other statistical information of the features. I created additional features that had a high correlation with the target variable. However, 
   this produced some unusual results.

**3. Preprocess Modelling:**

   In this section, I corrected the issue and applied some appropriate preprocessing techniques. I tested four (4) supervised machine learning 
   models and one (1) deep learning model. They are:

   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Naive Bayes
   - XGBoost
   - TensorFlow

**Conclusion:**
In this section, I summarized my findings, insights, and thoughts about this project.

Thank you for reading my project. I hope you find it interesting and informative.
